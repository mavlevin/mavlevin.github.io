My name is Guy Maverick Levin, and I go by Mav. My computer science passion started rather <i>explosively.</i> When I was 13, I had a lazy afternoon and I decided to build a rocket engine. However, on its first test it prematurely fired and exploded in my face. A burned nose and lost eyelashes led me to stay at home until my face healed. Bored and with no spare rocket engine parts, I decided to branch into computer science (less physically dangerous, hopefully). 

I taught myself how to program, then how to break programs, and in high school I (legally) hacked my country's national grading system. After graduating, I served in the military, founded [CyberQueens](https://cyberqueens.org/) and mentored my community's local FRC Robotics Team.

I now study Computer Science at [Stanford](https://profiles.stanford.edu/guy-levin), and founded [Stanford ZERO](https://zero.stanford.edu/), Stanford's Zero-Day Exploit Research Organiziation.
