My name is Guy Maverick Levin, and my childhood nickname has been "Guy what a Guy", so I decided to call my blog after that.

Today, I am a student at [Stanford University](https://profiles.stanford.edu/guy-levin) after serving more than four years in the signal intelligence [Unit 8200](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_8200).

My computer science passion started when I was 13, but probably not the way you think. It was a lazy afternoon and I decided to build a rocket engine. However, on its first test it prematurely fired and exploded in my face. A burned nose and lost eyelashes led me to stay at home until my face healed. Bored and with no spare rocket engine parts, I decided to branch into computer science (less physically dangerous, hopefully). I taught myself how to program, then how to break programs, and in high school I hacked my country's national grading system. After graduating high school, I served in the military, founded [CyberQueens](https://cyberqueens.org/) and mentored my community's local FIRST FRC Team.
