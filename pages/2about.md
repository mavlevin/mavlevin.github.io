My computer science passion started when I was 13, but probably not the way you think. It was a lazy afternoon and I decided to build a rocket engine. However, on its first test it prematurely fired and exploded in my face. A burned nose and lost eyelashes led me to stay at home until my face healed. Bored and with no spare rocket engine parts, I decided to branch into computer science (less physically dangerous, hopefully). I taught myself how to program, then how to break programs, and in high school I hacked my country's national grading system. After graduating high school, I served in the military, founded [CyberQueens](https://cyberqueens.org/) and mentored my community's local FIRST FRC Team.
